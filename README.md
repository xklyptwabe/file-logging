Write a program in C that calculates the value of the expression from laboratory
work No. 1 Appendix 1 “Calculation of given arithmetic expressions.” Read the values
of parameters X, Y, Z from a given binary file (entered by the user from the
keyboard). Write the result to a file, also specified by the user. The file format
(binary or text) is also specified by the user. At the same time, the program's operation
must be logged. The execution of main events, starting from the start of the
program, must be reflected in the log file with time stamps (the location is to be chosen
independently). Old records in the log file must be preserved. List of events for logging:
• program start
• opening a file with parameters
• calculation of the expression value
• writing the calculated value to the output file
• program termination
